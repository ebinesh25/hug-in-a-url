# Hug-In-A-Link 🤗

Send someone a warm hug with one click.

No accounts. No servers. Just good vibes.

## Why I built this

I like sending hug GIFs to friends.  
I thought, “Can the whole message live inside one link?”  
Turns out, yes! So I built it for fun.

## What it can do

- Write a name and a short message.  
- Pick a hug GIF or paste your own.  
- The link holds the message. It’s encrypted, so only the person with the link can read it.  
- Works on phones and computers.
